i ve figured out why i dislike this song it s supposed to be a power ballad right something that s uplifting and motivating by the end however the final chorus has no extra umph at the end and actually sounds just like the first one instead of crescendo ing into a powerful finish roar just says on the same wavelength it falls flat
