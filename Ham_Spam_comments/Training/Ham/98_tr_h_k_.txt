my honest opinion it s a very mediocre song nothing unique or special about her music lyrics or voice nothing memorable like billie jean or beat it before her millions of fans reply with hate comments i know this is a democracy and people are free to see what they want but then don t i have the right to express my opinion please don t reply with dumb comments lie if you don t like it don t watch it i just came here to see what s the buzz about 661 million views and didn t like what i saw ok
